We are located at MGIMO Odintsovo campus, which is
becoming our university hub for technology initiatives,
including broad use of machine learning in social sciences,
study of financial sector innovations, event and media, and
seamless digitally-enabled international trade.

We run this website from [a Github repo](https://github.com/finec-mgimo),
check it out for more curriculum documentation, code and data projects.

Please [reach us](/contacts) if you have any questions
about student affairs (admissions, transfers or
academic exchanges), joint research or other academic
cooperation initiatives.

## Degree Programs

Our current programs are in Russian, yet are looking forward
to offer more content in English and other languages.
